/**
 * A hash table is a data structure that's *unordered*. Instead we have "keys" and "values" where we
 * computed an address in memory using the key.
 *
 * The basic idea is that we have keys that are "hashable" (which we'll get to
 * in a second) and can be used to add, access, and remove from memory very
 * efficiently.
 *
 *     var hashTable = new HashTable();
 *
 *     hashTable.set('myKey', 'myValue');
 *     hashTable.get('myKey'); // >> 'myValue'

  /**
   * In order to store key-value pairs in memory from our hash table we need a
   * way to take the key and turn it into an address. We do this through an
   * operation known as "hashing".
   *
   * Basically it takes a key and serializes it into a unique number for that
   * key.
   *
   *    hashKey("abc") =>  96354
   *    hashKey("xyz") => 119193
   *
   * You have to be careful though, if you had a really big key you don't want
   * to match it to a memory address that does not exist.
   *
   * So the hashing algorithm needs to limit the size, which means that there
   * are a limited number of addresses for an unlimited number of values.
   *
   * The result is that you can end up with collisions. Places where two keys
   * get turned into the same address.
   *
   * Any real-world hash table implementation would have to deal with this,
   * however, we are just going to glaze over it and pretend that doesn't happen.
